# Attention Ghost UNet++: Segmentation of Adipose Tissue and Liver in CT Images

This repository provides the implementation of **Attention Ghost UNet++**, a novel deep learning architecture designed for the segmentation of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and liver regions in computed tomography (CT) images. By incorporating Channel, Spatial, and Depth Attention mechanisms into the Ghost bottleneck layers, this model significantly improves segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.
